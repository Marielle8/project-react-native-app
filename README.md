# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This project was about learning how to use React Native and to practice using styled components for styling.

## The problem

I planned to make a magic-8 ball and use the shake-function of my phone. But I didn't get it to work so I changed my plan and went for an external API to fetch then interact with instead. Since I had put a lot of time at my first plan I didn't have so much time left so I decided to keep it very basic. I find an API with programming jokes so I decided to fetch that and show one new joke every time the user taps a button. I got stuck a couple of times with the styling but got help from members of my team to solve it. If I had more time I would have divided the code into several components instead of having everything in one file. I probably would have tried to change the font as well and put more effort into the styling.
